# Quantum Circuits with Qiskit

This jupyter notebook is a supplementary resource to the authorâ€™s working paper  _Quantum Computing: An Overview_. The paper aims to provide an accessible overview of quantum computing. We give high-level explanations of the key quantum properties that are leveraged by a quantum computer, along with the quantum mathematical formalism involved and references for further reading.

The notebook has the following sections:
  
   1. IBM Quantum Experience account 
   
   2. One qubit circuit
   
       2.1. Quantum Coin Game
       
   3. Bell states circuit
   
       3.1. Run on a quantum simulator
       
       3.2. Run on a real quantum processor


## Installation



Install requirements locally (ideally, in a virtual environment):

    pip install -r requirements.txt



To run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
